# Kidspiration-Website
Kidspiration is an English education website made by 5 young university students. This website has a goal that is to help Indonesian elementary students improve their English. Even if they still can't understand English material from their school's teacher. Hopefully, this website can be an alternate for their learning.

- ANIMATE CSS => https://animate.style/
